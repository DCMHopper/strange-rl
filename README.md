# Strange-RL

This is an ASCII roguelike based off `python-tcod` and the associated [Roguelike Tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/)

Conceptually this game is about walking through asteroids

I'm not keeping a devlog or anything right now, because other than some flavor elements I'm following the tutorial code almost exactly. If I end up extending this game beyond that tutorial, I'll add a changelog and possibly more documentation around development
